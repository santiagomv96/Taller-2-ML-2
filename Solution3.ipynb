    "the elbow method allaws by a graph to evidence how the variaty is lower when you choose a bigger number of clusters, this varitay insede the cluster is compute by the euclidean distance betwen the points and its cluster, this disteance will be 0 whe the cluster be the same rows, but there is an specific cuantity of clusters when the varibility try to get close to a 0 it is called the elbow, and that elbow is the optimal number of clusters "
